# FSharpWPF
a demo WPF application in F# language ready to use as starter template.

this will be a reference about making a Wpf application using .Net 5.0 and F# since there is no vailable template for this kind of project.

the idea here is to understand some F# basics to show how we can leverage the multi paradigm aspect, in one side we will use MVVM architectural pattern to manage our presentation logic, in the other side we will use functional approach to fill some business requirements.
